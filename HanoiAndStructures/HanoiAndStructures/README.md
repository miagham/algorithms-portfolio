#Custom Data Structures & Tower of Hanoi

This assignment was created for my Algorithms class to practice building core datastructures. I put
my own versions of a linkedList, stack, queue, and used them to create a simple console-based Tower of Hanoi game. 
The assignment is about understanding how these structures work rather than relying on .NET’s built-in collections.

To run the assignment open the solution in Visual Studio, build it, and start the console application.
The console will ask how many rings you want and then you can play by selecting which tower to move from and to.
The goal is to show understanding of basic of problem-solving in algorithms.
