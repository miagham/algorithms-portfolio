# Tree Structures Demonstration

This assignment shows the use of tree data structures using a real dataset. 
The program loads data from a text file, sorts the data, and inserts it into
a Binary Search Tree. An in-order traversal is then used to show that the tree 
was built correctly.


## Tree Structure Used
### Binary Search Tree 
- Each node stores one value.
- Values smaller than the current node go to the left.
- Values greater than or equal to the current node go to the right.
- This structure allows ordered data storage and traversal.

## Sorting Algorithm Used
### Insertion Sort
- The dataset is sorted before being inserted into the tree.
- This ensures the tree receives ordered input.
- Insertion Sort was chosen because it is simple and easy to explain.

- Best Case: O(n)
- Worst Case: O(n²)

This assignment shows how trees store data
and how to retrieve values in sorted order.
