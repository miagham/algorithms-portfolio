# Big O Notation

- O(1) Constant Time
The time taken does not depend on the input size.
The operation always takes the same amount of time,
such as accessing a single element in an array by index.

- O(n) Linear Time
The time taken is proportional to the input size. A common
example is going through every element in a list once.

- O(n²) Quadratic Time
The time taken is proportional to the square of the input size.
This often occurs when comparing every element in a list to every
other element using nested loops.

- O(2ⁿ) Exponential Time
The amount of work doubles with each addition to the input size. This can occur
in algorithms that split into two paths for every input item, such as certain
recursive solutions.
