# DataStructures
 
 This project shows four common data structures: arrays, dictionaries, stacks, and queues. 
 I used fruit names to make it easy to understand.

 ## What the program does
 - Stores fruit in a array and prints the items
 - Stores the same fruit in a Dictionary
 - Shows how a stack works using LIFO (Push and Pop)
 - Shows how a queue works using FIFO(EN/DEqueue)

 ## How to run it
1. Open solution in VS
2. Right-click DataStructures select Set as Startup Project
3. Click the start button to run it
