# Searching Algorithms Demonstration

This assignment has three common searching algorithms using a shared dataset of scores. 
The goal is to compare how each algorithm works, how efficient it is, and when each can be used.

## Algorithms Included
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Interpolation Search

This assignment shows how different searching techniques behave on the same dataset 
and why some algorithms are faster than others depending on how the data is organized.
