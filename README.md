## ASSIGNMENT 1 (notes) *week 1*
We have been starting to dive into understanding the big O notation, which is a very interesting but complex topic. Basically the Big O notation describes the performance of an algorithm by focusing on the runtime/space requirements. It is how we compare the efficiency of an approach to a problem.
*Ex.* O(1) is Constant: The operation takes the same time no matter the input size. Such as accessing an element in an array by its index.

*Ex.* O(n) is Linear time: The time taken is proportional to the input size. Such as going through every element in a list once.

*Ex.* O(n<sup>2</sup>) is Quadratic time: The time taken is proportional to the square of the size of the input size. Such as comparing every element in a list to every other element.

*Ex.* O(2<sup>N</sup>) is exponential: The work doubles with each addition to the input set. A process that splits into two paths for every input item.
