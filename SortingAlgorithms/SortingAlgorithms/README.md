# Sorting Algorithms Assignment

This project shows how different sorting algorithms work by running each one on the same set of numbers.
The goal is to see how each algorithm behaves, how fast it runs, and how many comparisons it makes.
The program loads a list of 474 scores, sorts them using each algorithm, and displays the results
in the console with a simple typewriter effect.

Each algorithm runs on its own copy of the data so the results stay fair. After running
the program shows the algorithm name, a short description, the best and worst-case Big-O times, 
the pseudocode, the time it took to sort, and the number of comparisons made. At the end the program
prints a summary that compares all algorithms side by side. This assignment helped me practice sorting techniques,
working with arrays, timing code, and measuring performance. It also shows how some sorting algorithms are much
faster than others even though they complete the same task.
